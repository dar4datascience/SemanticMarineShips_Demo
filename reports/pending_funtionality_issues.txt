## Notes about app 

 - vessel name selector does not dropdown at the beginning. Might be still loading?
 - vessel selector sometimes doesnt respont to clicks
 - use the box package for better function management
 - create more tests from shinytests
 - map doesnt display well in mobile, but minimap does. perhaps call base tile of world data
 - TESTs are weak and calling of functions maybe unneccesary
 - package the app as a package 
 - is projection correct on the leaftlet? some observations appear on land, maybe the boat is on repairs
